# A How-To Guide to the Churchill Lab

# Mission Statement

We apply a systems approach to study the genetics of health and disease, incorporating new statistical methods for the investigation of complex disease-related traits in the mouse. We develop new methods and software that will improve the power of quantitative trait loci mapping and gene expression analysis, as well as graphical models which aim to intuitively and precisely characterize the genetic architecture of disease. With an eye on the future of mouse genetics, we have also undertaken the task of establishing two new mouse resources for complex trait analysis: the Collaborative Cross and the Diversity Outbred.

To accomplish all this, we will write good code, perform solid and reproducible analyses, and disseminate our results widely through publications. We recognize that trust, both in the process and in our results, is of primary importance to the researchers who use our methods. Therefore, we strive to make our source code as open and accessible as possible. When we submit papers, we expect that the analytical code behind those papers will be something that we can be proud of. To these ends, we will provide reviewers and the scientific community with all source code required to generate figures in the paper that result from computational analyses.

# Expectations

**Your role:** We expect that you will take primary responsibility for the success of your research project and career development.
As a member of the lab, you are expected to participate fully in the team.
When disagreements about methodological approaches arise, you recognize that these should be resolved through a solid and reproducible analysis of available data.
In general, lab members are expected to be present from 9:30AM to 4:00PM on weekdays to facilitate discussion within the group.
If you aren’t sure — ask.

**Gary's role:** Gary’s goal is to facilitate your success as well as that of your project.
Within your project, Gary will serve as a sounding board for ideas, will help you plan your project, and will help to devise experiments to test your hypotheses.
To facilitate your success, Gary will help you to plan your training, to devise a career plan that can take you to where you want to go, and to provide guidance on other elements of career and project development as needed.

**Code of Conduct:** In addition to Jackson Laboratory norms, rules, and expectations, we have adopted the following code of conduct. All members of the research group are required to agree with the following code of conduct. Additionally, we collectively agree to enforce this code. We are expecting cooperation from all members to help ensure a safe environment for everyone.

THE QUICK VERSION
This research group is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), or choice of text editor. We do not tolerate harassment of group members or other colleagues in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any professional setting, including talks, workshops, parties, Twitter and other online media. However, do note that we work on biological matters so work-related discussions of e.g. animal reproduction are appropriate.

THE LESS QUICK VERSION
Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion, technology choices, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of the research environment, talks, or other events, inappropriate physical contact, unwelcome sexual attention, or creation of an otherwise sexualized environment.

Group members asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

If a member engages in harassing behavior, other group members and Gary Churchill may take any action they deem appropriate to stop this behavior. If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact Gary Churchill immediately. Gary Churchill is available to help group members contact security or local law enforcement, navigate official Laboratory reporting channels, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe in the research environment.

If Gary is the cause of the concern or you would prefer he not be involved, official concerns can be addressed by contacting the [Jackson Laboratory Human Resources](https://myjax-p.jax.org/HR/) office.

We expect research group members to follow these rules in all professional settings including the office, conferences, workshop venues, and group-related social events. We additionally expect members to treat each other professionally with respect to their work and workspaces, with constructive criticism, without dismissive behavior, and without disruption of shared working spaces.

**Authorship:** Our lab follows the guidelines from the (ICMJE's Uniform Requirements for Manuscripts Submitted to Biomedical Journals)[http://icmje.org/recommendations/browse/roles-and-responsibilities/defining-the-role-of-authors-and-contributors.html].

**Ethics:** We expect lab members to be honest in scientific communications both within and outside the lab.
We expect that lab members will design experiments in a manner that minimizes both bias and self deception.
We expect that lab members will keep agreements, be careful, and share their code and results openly with the scientific community.
We expect that credit will be given where credit is due, including in scientific writing.
Plagiarism is not tolerated.
In addition, please don't hesitate to raise any questions or concerns that you have at any point with Gary.

# Communication

## General

**Social Media:** Lab members are encouraged to communicate through public social media, and if you choose to do so then you are expected to follow our code of conduct.

**Projects:** By the nature of our research, lab members will often have the opportunity to participate projects managed via private or publicly accessible source code repositories.
In these cases, lab members are expected to: follow the code of conduct and expect that private repositories will be world accessible.

**IP/Openness:** This is handled in accordance with the instructions from our research sponsors and laboratory guidance.
Lab members must follow  the agreements with our sponsors, which often allow, encourage, or require openness.
If you have concerns at any point, set up a meeting with Gary to discuss these concerns.

**Accounts:** Lab members are expected to have accounts for the following and be members of the specified (organizations) if applicable:
+ GitHub ([churchill-lab])(https://github.com/churchill-lab)
+ cadillac.jax.org
+ helix.jax.org

## Meetings

**Lab Meeting:** Lab meeting is held weekly. Each member should be prepared to discuss the following:
1. What specific item(s) he/she accomplished in the past week.
2. What specific item(s) he/she plans to accomplish the coming week.
3. Who or what, if anyone or thing, is blocking him/her?
4. Who or what, if anyone or thing, is he/she blocking?

**Individual Meetings:** We schedule weekly individual meetings with Gary.
Once you join the lab, contact Gary (or Jessica Seavey) to set up a time.
These are set up for a term to accommodate Gary's packed schedule.
We don’t reschedule these meetings by default if one of the parties (Gary or you) are out of town, so if you do want to meet in a week but travel conflicts, contact Gary or Jessica Seavey to reschedule.
The goal of the weekly meeting is to:

1.  Discuss challenges.
2.  Plan strategy (project related, personal career, etc).

# Source Code, Data, and Reproducibility

**Pride:** We expect lab members to sign their code.
To quote from _The Pragmatic Programmer_:

> Craftsmen of an earlier age were proud to sign their work.
You should be, too…
People should see your name on a piece of code and expect it to be solid, well written, tested, and documented.

While some code will be proof-of-concept code, it should be of a form that inspires confidence.

**Language:** We write code for our analyses in Python or R, which allows everyone in the lab to know two languages and understand analytical code.
Code for visualization can be Python, R, or javascript.

**Licensing:** We expect code that we produce to be licensed under an open license (MIT or CC-BY).
Unless a funding agency requires something different, we'll use these.

**Version Control Services:** Our primary version control service is GitHub, and we have a [`churchill-lab` account](https://github.com/churchill-lab) there.
We expect that lab members will maintain their code in repositories under these team accounts.
However, lab member should not commit to the branch that is shown as default on GitHub for any of these repositories.
Instead commits happen as described below to facilitate code review.

**Creating a Churchill Lab Repository:**
1.  Create a new repository under the lab account.
2.  Immediately fork this repository into one that your user account owns.
3.  Make commits to your own repository, and move code back to the `churchill-lab` repository as described below.

**Getting Code into Churchill Lab Repositories:** Code moves from user repositories to `churchill-lab` repositories through a process of code review.
Code review is handled through pull requests.
The process is described briefly below.
Feel free to ask for guidance if you are uncomfortable with the process.
**We will revoke write access for failing to adhere to these rules.**

1.  Make changes to your code and commit them in your own repository first.
2.  Create a pull request into the repository owned by Churchill Lab.
3.  Name potential reviewers for your pull request.
4.  Once at least one lab member has approved your pull request, you or a reviewer may merge your pull request.
The only exception to this policy is this repository ("how-to-guide") where, in addition to the above rules, Gary must also approve the pull request.

**Composition of Pull Requests:** Each pull request may contain one or more changesets.
In keeping with good source control practice, each changeset or commit should contain *all* changes necessary for a particular fix or update.
In addition, each pull request should relate to no more than one functional area in the code base you are updating.
Keeping the pull request focused to one area makes it easier for your reviewers to provide thoughtful feedback.

**Reviewing Pull Requests:** We expect that all lab members will participate in review of pull requests.
If you get named by the submitter, it's courteous to review the request.
We have created a checklist to facilitate review.
As a reviewer, you are responsible for making sure that all checklist guidelines are followed.

**Projects that didn't work:** We expect that repositories will contain failures (e.g. proof-of-concepts that didn't work).
This is ideal.
Being able to find them will make sure we don't make the same failure twice.

**Non-Code Versioning:** Non-code documents should be kept in a place that maintains version history (e.g. Google Docs for word documents).

**Data Management:** For publicly available data, scripts used to download and process these data should be preserved, as should the versions of items used in processing (e.g. probe to gene mappings).
These items should be version controlled.
Where possible, intermediate files of reasonable size can be stored to facilitate re-use, but the process to regenerate these files from publicly available data should be preserved.
When we generate data, they should be stored in a location where they are replicated and uploaded to the relevant database as soon as possible (e.g. GEO for gene expression, SRA for sequencing).

**Reproducibility:** We expect all lab members to maintain code that performs reproducible analyses.
This can be in the form of makefiles, shell scripts, or other automation approaches that allow analyses to be automatically performed.
We expect that these scripts, including those to generate figures in papers generated as a consequence of such analyses, will be included in source control repositories and made publicly available before or concurrent with the submission of preprint (if submitted) or manuscripts.
Combined with the review guidelines, this means that all code must have been reviewed for these documents to be submitted.
